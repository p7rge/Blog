# Blog

It's already feels like ol' days when I was thinking how I've done Java in my college time.
And through all the time, I think I've already improved in some ways, and do some different programming languages
(But I still feel like I'm Noob XD)

So I decided to take my time awhile, and learn to master java again. Cause you know it is a great great programming language
for OOP fundamental

I don't know wheter my code in this repo is done well or not, but I think it is my part of small improvement in mastering programming
:)

So here, I have 3 packages, that is :

# Controllers

I just have one controller here, that is main controllers

# Models
I have 3 models here :
- User
- Articles
- User Factory

Yes, Like you guest in your mind. This is a very simple blog console apps. I think the models explain it all :D

# Views
I have 1 view file here that is MenuList.java, and I do my own way to separate the console view.
Please, please, really please if you think my code is not efficient or something like that just feel free to tell me and I will
really enjoy the discussion :D

# How to run this

Just clone it, run it with IDE or Terminal (Of course make sure that you already install JDK, setting path,etc XD)

For the first menu, will appear :

### Main Menu
1. Registrasi
2. Login
0. Keluar

Just select "Registrasi", then input your username and password. After that the program will bring you back to the Main Menu.
But now select login, and of course input your username and password that you've been created just now.

Then will appear

### Blog Menu
1. Tambah Artikel
2. Lihat Artikel
9. Logout
0. Keluar

Feel free to explore the code, select 1 for adding new article, select 2 to look at your article list. Then please hit 9 for logout.
Create new account or login again, do that several time. And I'm proudly tell you that for each article for each user are kept well XD

And so on, I think I will create 2 menus again for updating and deleting the article

Hope this code will give you some knowledge, and of course give me your opinion for this code XD
